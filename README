Compile and execute the program using:
    "python3 align.py some_input".

The scoring scheme can be altered by including the flag "--manual" on the 
command line followed by three numbers that assign match, mismatch, and gap
scores, respectively and in that order. Example:
    "python3 align.py aligntest.input1 > myoutput1 --manual 4 -2 -1"
